To implement the above task in an automation tool like Selenium WebDriver, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the repetitive tasks: Analyze the system and identify tasks that are performed frequently and manually by the users.

2. Develop a function to automate the identified tasks: Write a function using Selenium WebDriver and programming language (e.g., Java, Python) to automate the identified tasks. This function should interact with the web elements on the system and perform the necessary actions.

3. Use a framework for clear documentation and code structure: Utilize a testing framework like TestNG or JUnit to organize the code structure and provide clear documentation. This will help in maintaining the code and collaborating with other team members.

4. Implement best practices: Follow best practices in automation testing such as using Page Object Model, creating reusable functions, handling waits and assertions properly, and maintaining the code in version control.

5. Test the automation function: Test the automation function on different scenarios to ensure it works correctly and efficiently. Make necessary adjustments if needed.

6. Integrate the automation function into the test suite: Add the automation function to the existing test suite to run it along with other test cases. Schedule the execution of the automated task using tools like Jenkins for continuous integration.

By following these steps, we can effectively implement a feature to automate repetitive tasks in the system using an automation tool with clear documentation, code structure, and best practices.
